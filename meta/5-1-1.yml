  <p>&#x2022; Indicator 5.a.2, &#x2018;Proportion of countries where the legal
  framework (including customary law) guarantees women&#x2019;s equal rights to
  land ownership and/or control&#x2019;; and </p>

  <p>&#x2022; Indicator 5.6.2, &#x2018;Number of countries with laws and
  regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15
  years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information and

  <p>To avoid duplication, indicator 5.1.1 does not cover areas of law that are
  addressed under indicators 5.a.2 and 5.6.2. Indicator 5.1.1 complements these
  other indicators.</p>

  <p>Legal frameworks that advance gender equality generally relate to all of
  Goal 5 as well as other Goals since gender equality is central to the
  achievement of all SDGs. See UN Women and UN Statistics Division&#x2019;s
  annual <a
  href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/gender-snapshot/2021/"><em>Progress on the
  Sustainable Development Goals: The Gender Snapshot</em></a> which each year
  uses latest available data to demonstrate how gender equality, including
  progress on Target 5.1, is fundamental to achievement of all 17 Goals. </p>

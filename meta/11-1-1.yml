  To accommodate projected growth and to manage the existing housing demand, it
  is estimated that roughly 500 000 housing opportunities need to be created
  between 2021 and 2028. It is hoped that the Human Settlements Strategy can
  serve as a catalyst for the partnerships and cooperation required to meet this
  target. The number of human settlements opportunities (top structures)
  -2019/2020 consisted of a target of 2 565 and of which 2 738 opportunities
  were provided.
SDG_GOAL: 'Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable'
